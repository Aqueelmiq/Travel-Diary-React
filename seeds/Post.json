    "text": "Ever since my first visit to the City of Light as a child, I knew that I eventually wanted to live there, and my family knew it too, often retelling stories of me leap-frogging over the iconic street posts and disappearing down les petites rues. <br/> Skip forward to October 2015, after spending another two months travelling around Europe, I returned to my hometown, Perth (the most isolated capital city in the world). I always finish my trips in Paris because, well, it’s Paris! A couple of weeks later, back into the routine of my everyday life, the inevitable longing to return kicked in, and so without much planning, I booked a one-way flight and landed at Charles de Gaulle three months laterHiP Paris Blog, Editorial InternshipI have since returned to Australia and can’t say that my year in Paris was easy. Between studying to improve my French so I felt confident enough to apply for jobs, moving apartments four times, and battling to immerse myself in a foreign social environment that I had only ever really dipped a toe in, I often felt completely overwhelmed. On the flip side, I had an excitement and sense of energy that only comes from living in a cultural mecca like Paris, where every day provides the opportunity to experience and create something new. Plus, not to mention endless supplies of croissants, stinky cheeses on every corner, and super-cheap French wine! So, when the opportunity arose to work with HiP Paris as the Editorial Assistant, I knew that it would be a catalyst for an even more authentic vie parisienne and jumped at it. Beyond the tasks associated with the inner workings of running a successful blog – sourcing photography, uploading content to the site, and researching related stories – the experience encouraged me to observe deeper, question more, and create more valuable relationships.As a result, I have been able to share with you some of my own adventures and insights into what adds to the unique cultural fabric that is Paris. I have thoroughly enjoyed working with Erica, Editorial Director and Owner of Haven In, and Erin, our HiP Editor, who have both been so encouraging, and enabled me to develop new skills, and branch out of my comfort zone.Yet all good things must come to an end, and even though I’m sure this won’t be the last you hear from me, it is time to pass this incredible opportunity to the next Paris enthusiast, who will hopefully find it equally as rewarding and exciting.Think you’re a great fit and ready to hit the ground running?
